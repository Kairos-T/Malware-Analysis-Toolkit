# Malware-Analysis-Toolkit
The Malware Analysis Tool is a Python-based tool that performs static and dynamic analysis on Windows PE files. It leverages the capabilities of `pefile` and `frida` to extract information about the PE file structure, perform dynamic analysis using hooking techniques, and extract printable strings from the file.

## Features
- Static analysis: Extracts information about the PE file structure, including image base, entry point, number of sections, and imported functions.
- Dynamic analysis: Uses `frida` to perform dynamic analysis by hooking function calls, memory access, and API calls, and traces execution flow using Frida's Stalker module.
- String extraction: Extracts printable strings from the PE file.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kairos-T/Malware-Analysis-Toolkit
```
2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the malware analysis tool:
```
python malware_analysis_tool.py <path_to_pe_file>
```
Replace `<path_to_pe_file>` with the path to the PE file you want to analyse.
